# Python_Collatz_Conjecture
Python Collatz Conjecture Calculator


This is a short python program that checks if a number will reach 1 through the 'Collatz Conjecture' process.

I created this whilst learning how to program with Python 3.x. The program uses a while loop; some parameter passing, global variables, formatting, and some other interesting programming consepts.
